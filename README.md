### To apply the method on your task
Integrate `HSICClassifier` from `networks.py` and `HSICLoss` from `hsic.py` in your classification task

### ‚ù§Ô∏è To run the ECG experiments
1. Download and preprocess the PhysioNet 2017 data by running
    ```python
    python -m ECG.prepare_dataset
    ```
2. Train the main task
    ```python
    python -m ECG.train_main_task
    ```
    
3. To evaluate model validity, you may want to run
    ```python
    python -m ECG.train_independence
    python -m ECG.train_rep2label
    ```
4. To visualize the obtained activations:
    ```python
    python -m ECG.visualize_cam
    ```
    
### üß† To run the EEG experiments
Follow the same steps as in the ECG experiment above, replacing `ECG` with `EEG`
